Welcome! I'm Almona, a final year undergraduate student at Centre College studying Economics with a minor in Data Science. I enjoy working on data analysis and statistical modeling problems and applying these skills to real-world data.

Feel free to look at my resume and projects I have worked on.

I'm also on the track & field team, competing mainly in the 100m and 200m.

Fun fact: I have studied in three countries - Nigeria, South Africa, and now the US.
